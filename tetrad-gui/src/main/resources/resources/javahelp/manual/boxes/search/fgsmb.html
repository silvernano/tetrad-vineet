<p>The FGS-MB ("Fast Greedy Search, Markov Blanket) algorithm is a restriction of the
  FGS algorithm (see) to the problem of calculating the joint set of variables in the
  Markov blanket of a list of target variables, as well as the structure over those
  variables. It is guaranteed to produce the same result as if the FGS algorithm had
  been run and the result then restricted to the union of the Markov blankets of the
  target variables. (Give reference.)
