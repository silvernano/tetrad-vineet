### Vineet's PhD Thesis All Code

Included in here are a suite of java files for running causal discovery methods that handle latent variables and mixed continuous and discrete datasets. My thesis is focused on incorporating prior knowledge into these methods for biomedical research applications. Many of the outputs of this project are focused on analzying observational, static, multi-omics datasets. 

Here is a pictoral description of my thesis:
